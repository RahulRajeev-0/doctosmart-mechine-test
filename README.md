# Patient Profile Application

This repository contains the implementation of a patient profile management system, developed as part of a technical interview task. The backend uses Django REST Framework, while the frontend is built with React.js.

## Description

The application allows for the creation and management of patient profiles with the following required fields:
- First Name
- Last Name
- Gender
- Date of Birth
- Address
- Phone Number
